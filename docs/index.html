In the show Monty Hall (the host) would show the contestant 3 doors. Behind 1 of them was a prize, behind the other 2 were goats. This is the sequence of events that followed. </p> <ul> <li>The contestant would choose a door</li> <li>Then Monty would open one of the other doors which would always reveal a goat</li> <li>Then the contestant could choose to stick with their original choice or switch doors</li> </ul> <p>Most people at the time believed you should always stick with your first choice. But in 1975 someone calculated that if the contestant always decided to <strong>Switch Doors</strong> their odds of winning would basically double. </p> <p> <strong>The original odds of selecting the correct door are 1/3 or about 33%. If you always switch doors the odds should be 2/3 or about 66%. </strong> </p> <p>Below are 2 versions of the game. The top version will always choose to switch doors and the bottom will always stick with the original choice. <strong>Click the "Start" button to run the simulation. It will run 100 times and show the results of each iteration as well as the win/ratio. </strong> </p> </main> <div id="game-always-switch" class="game-container"> <div class="title-wrapper"> <span class="game-title">Always Switch Doors</span> </div> <div class="door-number-wrapper"> <div class="door-numbers">1</div> <div class="door-numbers">2</div> <div class="door-numbers">3</div> </div> <div class="doors-wrapper"> <div class="door-container"> <span class="prize prize-one"></span> <div class="door door-1"></div> </div> <div class="door-container"> <span class="prize prize-two"></span> <div class="door door-2"></div> </div> <div class="door-container"> <span class="prize prize-three"></span> <div class="door door-3"></div> </div> </div> <div class="wins-loses"> Wins: <span id="wins">0</span> Loses:<span id="loses">0</span> Win/Ratio: <span id="ratio">0</span>% </div> </div> <div id="startGame"> <p>The game above should win about <span class="percentage">66%</span> of the time.</p> <button id="start">Start</button> <p>The game below should win about <span class="percentage">33%</span> of the time.</p> </div> <div id="game-never-switch" class="game-container"> <div class="title-wrapper"> <span class="game-title">Never Switch Doors</span> </div> <div class="door-number-wrapper"> <div class="door-numbers">1</div> <div class="door-numbers">2</div> <div class="door-numbers">3</div> </div> <div class="doors-wrapper"> <div class="door-container"> <span class="prize prize-one"></span> <div class="door door-1"></div> </div> <div class="door-container"> <span class="prize prize-two"></span> <div class="door door-2"></div> </div> <div class="door-container"> <span class="prize prize-three"></span> <div class="door door-3"></div> </div> </div> <div class="wins-loses"> Wins: <span id="wins">0</span> Loses:<span id="loses">0</span> Win/Ratio: <span id="ratio">0</span>% </div> </div> </body></html>
